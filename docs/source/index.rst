**FermulerPy** is an attempt to perform number theory computations and visualize various functions through plots in python. This open
source package covers elementary number theory, analytic number theory, combinatorics, diophantine, probabilistic number theory methods,
and most importantly their visualization. The project attempts to implement most optimal algorithms related to different number theory
functions. Apart from this, the package covers some basic and useful mathematical functions (in constant module) that may assist you in 
performing number theory computations. It is released under the MIT licence.
