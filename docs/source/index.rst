Welcome to fermulerpy's documentation!
======================================


**FermulerPy** is an attempt to perform number theory computations and visualize various functions through plots in python. This open
source package covers elementary number theory, analytic number theory, combinatorics, diophantine, probabilistic number theory methods,
and most importantly their visualization. The project attempts to implement most optimal algorithms related to different number theory
functions. Apart from this, the package covers some basic and useful mathematical functions (in constant module) that may assist you in 
performing number theory computations. It is released under the MIT licence.

Applications of fermulerpy:

* Most optimized functions for Number Theory computations for e.g., using fermulerpy you can check if the number is prime or not in less
  than 0.2 ms for numbers as large as having 200 digits.
* Contain extensive functions for every field of Number Theory
* This package is very easy to use and has been designed in such a way that even a non-programmer person can use it. (See sample jupyter
  notebooks)
* Visualizing elliptical curves, patterns of divisor funstions, zeta function polar curves, etc is possible in few lines of code with 
  fermulerpy.
