Background and Motivation 
=========================


Recently, it has been seen that there is a shift in trend from traditional methods of research to computation based research. It is more
in the fields related to astrophysics, economics, etc. And the  most important requirement for such research is availability of tool. One 
cannot always start developing software tool and then carry out research. So, we took this initiative in Number theory field to develop a
package that can be used for both implementation and visualization of various quantities or functions of different fields of Number theory.

To achieve our objective, we clearly identified five requirements:

* People carrying out research may not have sufficient knowledge in programming
* Single package for both function implementation and visualization
* Most optimized and latest algorithms for functions
* Package should be useful for various fields of Number Theory
* Package documentation must contain tutorials for using it.

We adopted following steps to carry out the work for developing this package:

* Identify imortant functions related to submodule (pre-identified)
* Research on best possible algorithms for those functions
* Implement those algorithms in python
* Discuss time and space compexities with mentor
* Research on further optimizations possible
* Unit testing
* Comparison with other tool's execution time (if exist) like pari/gp, mpmath, etc.
